# Makov_Random_Field

Code to crete an Ising model with binary (1/-1) images, sample from the distribution using Gibb's-sampling and compare the probabilties with the actual distribution. Feel free to play with the parameters: 

height, width = image dimensions, do not make them to large so that it becomes computationally prohibitive to generate all possible images (required to compute the actual distribution) 
alpha = 0.01
beta = 0.05
